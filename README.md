# Bujuse - A tiny Warehouse manager for a tailoring shop

# NOTE 21/10/2021: THIS PROJECT IS NO MORE MAINTENED (I plan to rewrite it with NestJS + Angular 11) 

The idea is to create a simple inventory system for clothing items. The application is designed for artisans who need a simplified labeling and management tool for a warehouse.
The task is not to replace a complete product or solve the problems related to the taxation or the management nor the management of supplies and logistics.

## MEAN stack is the base
The stack under the hood is the MEAN one:
- Mongo DB
- Express.js 
- AngularJS (1.6.x)
- NodeJS

## Who is using Bujuse?
Obviously... www.buju.it
